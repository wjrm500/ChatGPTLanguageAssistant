Compare these two Spanish sentences, and provide a highly detailed breakdown of what has changed from the original to the modified version, and why it was changed. Give your answer as a numbered list, with each item in the list representing a single change. The numbered list should be of the form "1 | A was changed to B because of C\n2 | D was changed to E because of F". If no changes were made, simply output "No changes." If only one change was made, a numbered list of length one is fine.
